An interactive tilting scale that weighs rights and obligations between parties to determine who truly holds the leverage in a contract.

### 🛡️ Sentry Peek (Browser Extension)
A proactive Chrome extension that auto-detects legal links (Terms of Service, Privacy Policies) on any website and injects a **🛡️ Sentinel Badge** for one-click instant audits.

### ✍️ Intelligent Redlining
